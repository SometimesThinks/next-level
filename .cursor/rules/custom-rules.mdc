# Coding Environment

- TypeScript ^5
- React 19.1.0
- NextJS 15.5.0
- Tailwind ^3.4.17
- Schdcn

# Code Style and Structure

## Functions

- Prefer Arrow Functions over Function Declarations for components and callbacks.
- Utility or library functions that are independent of React context may still use function declarations.

## Export Rules

- Prefer **named exports** for components and utilities
- Use **default exports only** for special cases like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` in Next.js
